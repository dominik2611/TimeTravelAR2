# What this repository provides
It provides the ability to augment real world objects with images of the objects. This technique can be used to override a current real world building with an older image of the building and therefore provide a view on how it looked liked in the past.
There is also the ability to place any 3D Object into the world. 

Images can be load directly from within the app. After that they can be placed via a simple gui. The gui allows to change rotation, position and scale in choosable step widths.
Currently it is not possible to store the placed images so that they can be reloaded after the app was closed. 

# Whats next:
- storing the position of a manually placed image and anchor it to an marker to reload the placed image again.
